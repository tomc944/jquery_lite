##jQueryLite
This is a lightweight framework built using DOMs native API. All of the basic jQuery methods were programmed in order to give the user control of the DOM.

  string, or HTMLElement`

* `.ajax({options}) Perform an asynchronous HTTP request`
* `.append() Insert content to the end of each element in the set of matched elements`

  element in the set of matched elements`
